# Tumor Detection Code

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a tumor detection system using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. The code aims to classify images for the presence of tumors and can serve as a foundational example for more advanced tumor detection applications.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classifies input images to determine the presence of tumors.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes the MobileNetV2 model trained on the ImageNet dataset for quick deployment.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple functions for image preprocessing and prediction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

## Installation
To set up the environment, run the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Place your input image in the project directory or provide the path to the image in the code.

3. Update the `input_image_path` variable in the code with the path to your image.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python tumor_detection.py
   ```

5. The script will output the top three predicted classes with their confidence scores.

## Example
To test the code, you can use an image of a tumor or normal tissue. The model will provide predictions based on the input image.

## Future Work
- Fine-tune the model on a dedicated tumor detection dataset for improved accuracy.
- Implement additional functionality, such as visualizing predictions and performance metrics.
